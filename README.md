Introduction
Nowadays, most school students are learning from home and tend to be up to date from various technological fields. For an example, up to date with programming languages, database technologies, testing frameworks, designing subjects while achieving certificates and milestones. But most online systems are chargeable and users need to pay for the courses and get the certificates. But when it comes to school students’ knowledge gaining, they do not have sufficient income to pay for courses. Therefore, there should be a possible method to facilitate the learning and update new technological subjects for school students. 
By considering the above problem, we are suggesting this online education system (“GetITCertificates.com”) for school students to brush up and improve their knowledge. Using this system, students can access the system easily with their own system accounts and get the certificates by following the multiple courses. System is mainly divided into three modules as, user registration and login, profile management, course, and certificate management. Under these modules, system features are being developed. Students can register with the system and maintain their profiles, they can follow up the courses and at the end of the course module certificates are issued.
